*Problem:
Write a user-space program to parse information available in
/proc/bus/pci/ and /sys/bus/pci directories to print out which
devices are connected to a slot - slot number is the input
argument to the program.


*Solution1(test1.c):
Execute "lspci -v -mm -s <argv[1]>" and print the result.

*Solution2(test2.c):
Execute "lspci -mm -s <argv[1]>", and parse and print the result.
I made this for C practice and the output is same as Solution1.
I couldn't figure out all of the type of the information(ex."Device", "Class", "Vendor"...) and options that begin with "-"(ex."-r", "-p").
So I programmed it so that I could easily add types later. 


*output0_.txt:
This is the output of executing test1 with argument "0" in my environment (like "./a.out 0").
